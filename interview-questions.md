# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: The difference between a parameter and an argument is that a parameter is an element such as an object, array, number. While the argument is part of the logical task given to the output.

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable in the function, and an argument is what is being passed in the function.


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: Great question! I do not know what the parameters would be but I do know that .map() is a built in method that returns a new array with a conditional. 

Researched answer: The predefined parameters that the JavaScript built in method .map() uses are element, index, and array. The element is what is being processed in the array. The index is based on the element being processed in the array. And the array is what .map() called on. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: The difference between map and filter is that map is making a new array by changing the elements in the array one by one. Filter is actually creating a brand new array by taking off elements that don't correspond. 

Researched answer: Map is modifying the individual elements in an array, while filter is making a new array as well as taking off the elements that don't belong there. 

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is used in for loops as the computer is running the loop given until the condition that that was set is met.

Researched answer: When a loop is repeating the code given until the condition is met. Each time the computer is repeating the code or "going through the loop", then that is an iteration.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: A class can only be established once. An object can be established multiple times. 

Researched answer: A class is the template where objects are created, and a object is inside of the class and can be made more than once.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting in JavaScript is when JavaScript is able to prioritize certain commands before others automatically.

Researched answer: In JavaScript, Hoisting is when JavaScript is able to move declarations (like let variables) to the top and read it as if it were written at the top of the code.
